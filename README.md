# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM - Project Summary

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting stock prices using **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**, a powerful deep learning model designed for sequential data. Over the span of several weeks, the program introduced foundational concepts and tools in Python, data science, and financial analytics, gradually leading toward advanced modeling techniques for stock price forecasting.

The project was divided into multiple learning and implementation phases, each building on the previous one to develop both conceptual clarity and practical skills.

## Weekly Breakdown

### Week 1: Python & Data Science Fundamentals

The first week was dedicated to learning Python programming essentials and popular data science libraries. The objective was to get comfortable with basic syntax, data structures, and tools widely used in machine learning projects.

**Topics Covered:**

* Python syntax and basic operations
* Jupyter notebooks and Python IDEs
* Importing and managing datasets
* **Libraries introduced:**

  * NumPy – numerical operations and array manipulations
  * Pandas – data manipulation, cleaning, and DataFrame operations
  * Matplotlib and Seaborn – data visualization and plotting graphs

By the end of this week, participants were able to import stock data, clean it, and create basic visualizations to understand data trends.

### Week 2: Hands-On Assignments on Data Handling

Week 2 featured assignments to reinforce the concepts introduced in Week 1. These tasks were essential for building confidence in data preprocessing and visual analysis.

**Key Tasks:**

* Handling missing values
* Slicing and indexing DataFrames
* Plotting moving averages and closing price trends
* Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA)

These assignments not only strengthened our grasp over data manipulation but also prepared us for real-world stock datasets.

### Week 3: Financial Data and Machine Learning Introduction

This week marked the beginning of domain-specific learning. We explored the world of stock markets, key financial metrics, and how AI/ML intersects with finance.

**Topics Covered:**

* Stock market basics: What stocks are, how they work, and what influences their prices
* Technical indicators: Introduction to RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.
* Machine Learning Overview:

  * Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning
  * Time series forecasting principles
* Financial Data Sources:

  * Yahoo Finance API (yfinance library)
  * Data formats and cleaning for stock data
* A comprehensive PDF on technical analysis was also shared for further reference.

By the end of the week, we could understand how financial markets behave and how technical tools assist in analysis.

### Week 4: Assignment on Technical Analysis & ML Application

The fourth week’s assignment focused on implementing machine learning and technical analysis concepts to real stock data.

**Skills Applied:**

* Applying moving averages and other indicators to actual stock data
* Using yfinance to fetch historical stock prices
* Visualizing trends and predicting momentum
* Building a basic ML pipeline for forecasting (e.g., regression on stock prices)

These assignments helped bridge the gap between theory and implementation and provided the confidence to work with live datasets.
